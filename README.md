Note: 
<br>
I made a tangram puzzle to get better at CSS/Sass and Javascript/Jquery, and because I've been wanting to make this for a while. I intentionally limited myself to these technologies and HTML. 
<br>
<br>
To do:
  <br><s>make shapes using clip path</s>
  <br><s>make 6 templates total</s>
  <br><s>make navigation to choose template</s>
  <br><s>refactor the movement code so it is more natural (and uses arrow keys only)</s>
  <br><s>add some fun thngs</s>
  <br><s>refactor js code one more time</s>
  <br><s>get a code review from someone</s> THANKS JOEY!

<br>
Maybe one day:
  <br> IE and Safari version
  <br>mobile version
  <br>programmatically generate templates and figure out which ones are best for the game and which are easier/harder to solve (maybe using user input to determine difficulty)
  <br>add game mode, where templates get gradually harder and include more shapes? 
  <br>create answers and allow player to reveal them?
